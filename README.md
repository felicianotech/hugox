hugoX is a build of Hugo (the static site generator) with additional/experimental features.
It stands for "Hugo eXtra".

hugoX isn't a hard fork of Hugo.
Instead, it's what I'm calling a "parallel fork".
Each release of Hugo will be incorporated back into hugoX.
You can learn much more about Hugo and contribute that beaufitul from by visiting [the Hugo Readme](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/README.md).

With hugoX, you'll always be able to do everything that you can do with Hugo, plus a little bit eXtra.
